# OpticDome
An iron dome that tracks and shoots laser at red targets
The old file is a version that runs with a server that communicates with a react website. The other version works by button.
These controling methods are used to make the robot active or not.
Take note that while using the server version you might have some CORS problems depending on howl you deploy your server and react site.
For recognising targets we used OpenCV.
